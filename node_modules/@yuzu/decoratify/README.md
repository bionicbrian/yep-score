# decoratify
A browserify transform that provides a mini framework for macro-like transformers that work like decorators.

To enable, add to the package.json browserify field.
Note: **It should become before `babelify`.**

```javascript
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      [
        "@yuzu/decoratify"
      ],
      [
        "babelify", { "optional": ["es7.decorators"] }
      ]
    ]
  }
```
