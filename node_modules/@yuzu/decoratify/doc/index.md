# browserify transform: decoratify

This browserify transform decorates a "class" or default export of a module.
The actual work will be delegated to transformer modules with the help of a `TransformWriter`.

## `decoratify` vs ES `decorator`?
What's the difference? Good question.
ES decorators are just functions that are run on JS structures at runtime. These functions are usually used to decorate a class or a method with additional behavior.
Babel now comes with support for es decorators. This package IS NOT THAT.

The `decoratify` module is *run during buildtime* via the browserify transform plugin system. This makes these transformers work more like macros in that you can do metaprogramming, adding new code to the module.

This translates into `decoratify` adding decorators automatically for you.
Most of the decoratify transformers look for clues in your code before decorating the module. One checks the path of the module, one looks for a class with constructor dependencies.

## bundled transformers

At the moment the following transformers are enabled:

## `AutoDecorateInjectTransformer`
Checks if a module has a default export that is looking for dependencies injected into it's constructor. If so, an `@inject` decorator is automatically added to your module with the names of the constructor params passed in.
*NOTE If you want to supply `@inject` to your export but it is NOT the default export decoratify will not work for you. Instead manually insert the `@inject` decorator.*

## `ComponentNameSetter`
Checks to see if a module is a UIComponent or action based on filepath (lib/ui and lib/action). If so, code is decorated with `componentName` property equaling the name of the file. This componentName is used by the app framework for namespacing, and registering into the IOC spec.

## `DecorateClassTransformer`
The main transformer that looks for `// @decorator(x)` comment blocks.
This transformer can be registered with custom decorator transformers in order to handle custom transforming for a specific decorator.
