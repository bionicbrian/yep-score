# store schema

The storage component exposes the `StoreSchema` class so that other components can create their own schemas for their specific data.

Schemas are used by cloud mappers to know what are valid fields to save/push up to the cloud.

In addition, schemas are used by the [ModelData mappings decorator](./md-adapter-mapping.md) for declartive data mapping for MDs.

## example usage
```javascript
import { StoreSchema } from "@yuzu/storage";

export var fooSchema = new StoreSchema({
    namespace: "foo",
    key: "id",
    foreignKeys: ["parentId"],
    fields: [
        "title",
        "description",
        "size"
    ]
});
```

Sometimes one component will define a schema, but allow other components to extend the schema (adding feature specific fields)

```javascript
import { fooSchema } from "@yuzu/foo";

export default fooSchema.extend({
    namespace: "textSettings",
    fields: [
        "favorites",
        "theme"
    ]
});
```
