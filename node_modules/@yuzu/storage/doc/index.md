## configuring storage.
@yuzu/storage does not come w/ any stores built it.
It is up to the rest of the application to declare their needs.
Component can add to the `App.config.stores` array.
When the `StoreRegistry` object is created it pulls from this config and creates the stores for the entire app.

The registry is available in the DI spec as `stores`.

For more see [Configuring and declaring stores](./configuration.md).

## model data adapter
Most models in the application encapsulate and require data.
The model defines the interface which we call `ModelData`.
As `storage` components provides the data layer for the app we then have to perform mapping or adapt our model data api to our store values.

Since a lot of this logic can be shared, the storage component comes w/ a
ModelData object that acts a base class for adapting to the MD interface.

For more see [Model Data Adapter](./md-adapter.md)

In addition, the ModelData class comes with a decorator for easy mapping of md to sv properties.
